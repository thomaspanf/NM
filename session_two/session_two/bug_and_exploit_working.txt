REPO: https://github.com/Olugbenga2000/Smart-Contract-Playground
TESTING THE EXPLOIT SCENARIO
NOTE: p1 = person1, p2 = person2 etc...
NOTE: m1 = malicious1
-----------------------------------------------------------
If there are 4 legitimate depositors who deposit:
p1 = 100
p2 = 200
p3 = 300
p4 = 400
And the malicious `depositAddress` is here to be mean and try to get free tokens
m1 = 9000

Therefore a total of 1000 deposit (legit)
Therefore a total of 10000 deposit (including malicious)

How does the share of tokens go?

p1_percent  = (100 * 1,000) / 10,000
            = 10
p2_percent  = (200 * 1,000) / 10,000
            = 20
p3_percent  = (300 * 1,000) / 10,000
            = 30
p3_percent  = (400 * 1,000) / 10,000
            = 40
m1_percent  = (9,000 * 1,000) / 10,000
            = 900

If there are 100,000 vaultTokens

p1_receive  = (10 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 1000
p2_receive  = (20 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 2000
p3_receive  = (30 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 3000
p4_receive  = (40 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 4000
m1_receive  = (900 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 90000

-----------------------------------------------------------
AT THIS POINT I REALIZE THERE MAY BE A BUG
NOTE: I use the same pX_percent values as the working above
-----------------------------------------------------------
But now if we do a bug test...
p1_receive  = (10 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 1000

//CONTRACT BALANCE IS NOW 99,000

p2_receive  = (20 * 99,000) / 1000
            = 1980

//CONTRACT BALANCE IS NOW 97020

p3_receive  = (30 * 97,020) / 1000
            = 2910

//CONTRACT BALANCE IS NOW 94110

p4_receive  = (40 * 94,110) / 1000
            = 3764

//CONTRACT BALANCE IS NOW 90346

m1_receive  = (900 * 90346) / 1000
            = 81311

//EVERYBODY HAS REDEEMED THEIR SHARES BUT THERE ARE STILL (90345 - 81311 = 9034) SHARES
//THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CLAIMED AND ARE NOW LOCKED FOREVER

-----------------------------------------------------------
HOW ABOUT WITH TWO ADDRESSES ONLY? DOES THE BUG STILL HAPPEN?
-----------------------------------------------------------
p1_deposit = 400
p2_deposit = 600

Therefore total deposit is 1000
Let's say vaultToken amount is 100,000

p1_percent  = (400 * 1,000) / 1,000
            = 400
p2_percent  = (600 * 1,000) / 1,000
            = 600
p1_receive  = (400 * 100,000) / 1000
            = 40000

// BALANCE IS NOW 60,000

p2_receive  = (600 * 60,000) / 1000
            = 36000

// BALANCE IS NOW (60,000 - 36,000 = 24000) EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY HAS CLAIMED
